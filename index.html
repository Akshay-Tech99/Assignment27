It offers a wide range of services, including computing power, storage, databases, machine learning, networking, and more, all delivered over the internet. GCP enables businesses to build, deploy, and scale applications and services quickly and efficiently without the need to invest in or manage physical infrastructure.

        Starting from 1998 with the launch of Google Search. google has developed one of the largest and most powerful IT Infrastructures in the world. Today, this infrastructure is used by billions of users to use services such as Gmail, YouTube, Google Photos, and Maps.

        <p style="text-align:center;color:cadetblue"><u>IAAS</u></p>
        <p>Infrastructure as a service, or IaaS, delivers on-demand infrastructure resources to organizations via the cloud, such as compute, storage, networking, and virtualization. Customers don’t have to manage, maintain, or update their own data center infrastructure, but are responsible for the operating system, middleware, virtual machines, and any apps or data. </p>
            <p style="text-align:center;color:crimson"><u>SAAS</u></p>
            <p>Software as a service, or SaaS, provides the entire application stack, delivering an entire cloud-based application that customers can access and use. SaaS products are completely managed by the service provider and come ready to use, including all updates, bug fixes, and overall maintenance. Most SaaS applications are accessed directly through a web browser, which means customers don’t have to download or install anything on their devices. </p>
            <p style="text-align:center;color:chartreuse"><u>PAAS</u></p>
            <P>Platform as a service, or PaaS, delivers and manages all the hardware and software resources to develop applications through the cloud. Developers and IT operations teams can use PaaS to develop, run, and manage applications without having to build and maintain the infrastructure or platform on their own.
